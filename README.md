# Expo CLI Development Server Random Crashes

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server randomly crashes without providing any error messages in the console. This makes debugging very difficult, as there is no indication of the cause of the crash.

The bug is particularly frustrating because it occurs randomly, making it hard to reproduce consistently. This report includes the original problematic code and a proposed solution.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `expo start` to start the development server.
5. Observe the development server for random crashes.  The exact timing is unpredictable.

## Proposed Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the code to find potential sources of unexpected behavior such as infinite loops, unhandled exceptions, or memory leaks, often stemming from asynchronous operations.  The provided solution code is designed to prevent these potential issues.   In certain cases, checking Expo's release notes for known issues or upgrading Expo CLI might resolve the problem.
